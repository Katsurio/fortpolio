                                        Jef functioned as a crucial member of the delivery team at Tevora for
                                        about a year. During that time, he distinguished himself through several
                                        exemplary behaviors he exhibited. First and foremost, Jef showed he was a hard
                                        worker who was not afraid of long hours. He regularly volunteered to put in the
                                        extra time so he could go the extra mile and ensure the user experience was up
                                        to his high standards. Jef has demonstrated flexibility in working with a team.
                                        As with other development environments, he frequently has needed to work with
                                        other developers, engineers, and customers and has shown he has the
                                        interpersonal skills to be successful in this. Heâ€™s always been willing to learn
                                        something new, even new programming languages. This also extended to learning
                                        new skills outside of software development, as the opportunities presented
                                        themselves. Finally, Jef championed developing new processes for our internal
                                        development team. He headed up an effort to revise our existing SDLC. He also
                                        took lead on a project focused on revamping our code storage and archiving
                                        practices, to great success. Throughout his time, he demonstrated his value to
                                        the team and left large shoes to fill.</p>

                                        John is a dedicated, hard-working developer. I had the pleasure collaborating
                                        with him on Fridge2Plate.com. &quot;Give up&quot; is not a phrase found in John's
                                        dictionary. He was quite savvy in finding solutions to the problems we had
                                        incorporating the BrainTree payment system. I know I can trust John to
                                        accomplish the task given to him and he won't stop working even when everyone
                                        else has already gone home.</p>

                                        Throughout the many years I've known John, he's proven to be someone I can
                                        always trust to put his best foot forward. He has a knack for exploring ideas
                                        and tackling problems from unexpected angles, and he takes an active interest in
                                        any project he's involved. He also has a great eye for detail, sense of humor,
                                        and communication skills. I highly recommend John to anyone looking for a great
                                        team player that'll exceed expectations and add a unique perspective and quality
                                        to their project.</p>
