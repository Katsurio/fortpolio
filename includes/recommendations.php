                                        John is a dedicated, hard-working developer. I had the pleasure collaborating with him on
                                        Fridge2Plate.com. &quot;Give up&quot; is not a phrase found in John's dictionary. He was quite savvy
                                        in finding solutions to the problems we had incorporating the BrainTree payment system. I know
                                        I can trust John to accomplish the task given to him and he won't stop working even when
                                        everyone else has already gone home.</p>

                                        Throughout the many years I've known John, he's proven to be someone I can always trust to put
                                        his best foot forward. He has a knack for exploring ideas and tackling problems
                                        from unexpected angles, and he takes an active interest in any project he's involved.
                                        He also has a great eye for detail, sense of humor, and communication skills. I
                                        highly recommend John to anyone looking for a great team player that'll exceed
                                        expectations and add a unique perspective and quality to their project.</p>
